* Summary
** Presentation
+ Thesis Student: David Arroyo Menéndez
+ Title of these slides: Towards an International Dataset about Names,
  Gender and Frequency
+ Thesis Director: Jesús González Barahona

** Ethical Motivation

+ Gender Equality is the 5th Objective in United Nations.
+ Only when you can measure a process, you can improve it.
+ Reducing costs in the process in Free Software way, more academic
  people can measure it.

** Contributions to the State of Art presented:

+ An integrated solution where make experiments in the different
applications field relative to infering gender from the name.

+ A collection of Open Datasets retrieved from statistical sources
and standarized in an unique format about gender, name and frequency

+ A new study applying DameGender to count males and females in
GNU/Linux

+ A new Machine Learning approach classifyng gender from names

+ An approach based on reproducibility.


** Academic Disciplines that could be finding profit on it

+ Social Sciences: Secondary Sources in Gender Studies, Indicators
  about Gender Gap
+ Computer Science: Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing
+ Lingüistics: Studies about names

** Research Works using these Open Datasets

+ Gender Gap in Knowledge: Wikipedia, Twitter, Newspapers, Journal
  Papers, ...
+ Gender Gap in Software Engineering: Git, StackOverflow, ...
+ Lingüistics: Statistics in each language about number of last
  letters, first letters, phonems, ... in males females

** Damegender: A Toolkit measuring Gender Gap with an Approach on Reproducibility

Current State:
+ Interface with Commercial APIs
+ Automatically generate thousands of counts in CSV, Git, Mailing
  Lists, ...
+ To allow Machine Learning in nicknames and diminutives.
+ Comparing using statistical tools: features in names, accuracies,
  confusion matrices, roc, principal component analysis, ...

** Damegender: Open Dataset

+ Accuracy: 87.6%
+ Number of females names: 299870
+ Number of males names: 278981
+ Open Data retrieved only from statistical institutions
+ More than 20 countries
