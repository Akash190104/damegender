* Summary
** Abstract

Nowadays there are various APIs to detect gender from a name. In this
paper, we offer a tool to use and compare these apis and a method to
classify male and female applying machine learning and using
a free license. The gender detection from a name is useful to make
gender studies from social networks, mailing lists, software
repositories, articles, etc.

** Download source and article to a make a good tracing

** Social Need (I)

The value to detect the gender in a name using machine learning is
related with new names don't registered in census as male or female.
On situations using *nicknames, new names, diminutives*, ... the humans
knows the gender in an intuitive way. Lingüistic features and
statistics about male or female, countries, ... in a name could be
interesting to decide give a name to a baby.

** Social Need (II)

In this moment there are a *gender gap* between males and females in
computer science and science in general (STEMM: Science, Technology,
Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine). Create *free tools* and
improve the current state of art allows measure and later create
policies with facts to fix the situation.

** Underlying Scientific Technologies

+ Scikit
+ NLTK
+ Numpy
+ Matplotlib
+ Perceval

** Datasets

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ python3 api2gender.py Laura --surname="Cornejo" --api=namsor
female
scale: 1.0
#+END_SRC

+ Poor explicative power

** Census Open Data

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ python3 main.py David --total="ine"
David gender is male
363559  males for David from INE.es
0 females for David from INE.es
#+END_SRC

+ Precise explanation from a Statistical Institute

** Give me informative features

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ python3 infofeatures.py
Females with last letter a: 0.4705246078961601
Males with last letter a: 0.048672566371681415
Females with last letter consonant: 0.2735841767750908
Males with last letter consonant: 0.6355328972681801
Females with last letter vocal: 0.7262612995441552
Males with last letter vocal: 0.3640823393612928
#+END_SRC

+ A female distinguish feature is the last letter a.
+ A male distinguish feature is the last letter consonant.

With Machine Learning we can guess nicknames, new names, or diminutives

** Proof of Concept in Repositories

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ python3 git2gender.py https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval.git --directory="/tmp/clonedir"
The number of males sending commits is 15
The number of females sending commits is 7
#+END_SRC

** Proof of Concept in Mailing Lists

#+BEGIN_SRC
# Count gender from a mailing list
$ cd files/mbox
$ wget -c http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201706.mbox
$ cd ..
$ python3 mail2gender.py http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/
The number of males sending mails is 6
The number of females sending mails is 0
#+END_SRC

** Conclusions

The market of gender detection tools is dominated by companies based
on *payment services through APIs*. This market could be changed thanks
to *free software tools and open data* due to give more explicative
results for the user. Although the *machine learning* techniques is not
new in this field, it's *an incentive for researchers* in computer
science create free software tools.

These advances in computer science could be giving support to study
the gender gap in repositories and mailing lists.
