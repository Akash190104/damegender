#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ python3 confusion.py
A confusion matrix C is such that Ci,j is equal to the number of observations known to be in group i but predicted to be in group j.
If the classifier is nice, the diagonal is high because there are true positives
Namsor confusion matrix:
 [[ 3  0  0]
 [ 0 16  0]
 [ 0  2  0]]
Sexmachine confusion matrix:
 [[ 2  1  0]
 [ 2 14  0]
 [ 1  1  0]]

# To deploy a graph about correlation between variables
$ python3 corr.py
# To create the pickle models in files directory

** Damegender as an exercise to practice NLTK and Perceval

** Damegender and the bussiness
+ In CMS: wordpress, drupal, joomla
+ In dictionaries: google translate, babylon, gnu dict, ...
+ Enciclopedias: wikipedia,  ...
--
+ A good technical project has a good bussiness project and an interfaz for end users.
+ A Free Software license and community can be a good point.
