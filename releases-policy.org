You must execute with sucess all test in master:
$ nosetest3 test
$ ./testsbycommands.sh
$ ./testsbycommandsextra.sh
$ pep8 src/damegender

Now you can upload to pypi:
$ python3 setup.py register sdist
$ twine upload dist/damegender-0.1.33.tar.gz
$ python3 -m venv /tmp/d
$ cd /tmp/d
$ source bin/activate
$ pip3 install damegender

Later you must check test in the python environment:

$ nosetest3 test
$ ./testsbycommands.sh
$ ./testsbycommandsextra.sh
